Command line tool I use to block websites to keep me focused.

Like always, reinventing the wheel, because it's fun.
```bash
# MUTOMBO_START #
# MUTOMBO_END #
```
Must be added to `/etc/hosts`

`.mutombo` file must be added to ~/.

`mutombo.txt` must have block list.

Example usage:
```bash
alias block="sh $HOME/.dotfiles/dependencies/github/when-harry-met-sally/mutombo/toggle.sh"
```
